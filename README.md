# RandomizerV

A mod that (attempts) to randomize certain game elements to add more fun to it.

This is very WIP right now and should only be used as either a sneak preview or by people who are interested in contributing.
Binaries will not be provided currently.

There are still a lot of testing leftovers in the codebase currently, these will be cleaned up as I fully implement stuff.

## Implemented Randomizers

- Mission Vehicle Randomizer (for everything that uses `CREATE_VEHICLE`)

- Vehicle Colors and Upgrades Randomizer

- Weapons Randomizer

- HUD Color Randomizer

- Labels Randomizer

## TODOs

- Randomize Traffic

- Randomize colors for HUD elements in rainbow style

- Option to randomize ALL labels

- More randomizers (cutscenes, audio banks, missions?, etc.)
